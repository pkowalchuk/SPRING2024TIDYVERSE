- Ursula Podosenin- I extended Puja Roy's Tidyverse CREATE assignment by adding two additional columns, one for the overall average price, and one that labels a drink as "cheaper" or "more expensive" when compared against the average price. I also plotted the frequency of the overall average of coffee prices and found the min and max values in the aata set.
- Mohammed Rahman - I created a Vignette for Dplyr and Tidyverse packages: <https://github.com/mrahman234/SPRING2024TIDYVERSE/blob/main/tidyverse_create_mohammed.Rmd> <br />

-   Fares Alahdab (part-2): using the interesting dataset on NY shooting incidents and associated RMD file (<https://github.com/pkowalchuk/SPRING2024TIDYVERSE/blob/main/TidyverseCreateAssignment.Rmd>), I made the following edits: (1)- I added the variable "STATISTICAL_MURDER_FLAG" to the variables kept from the main dataset when filtering as that seems important. (2)- The second bar plot for the victim age groups was missing the vic_age_distribution so I added it to code chunk 7. (3)- Using dplyr and ggplot2, I added a heat map showing the frequency of incidents by both the perpetrators' and victims' age groups. (4)- Focusing on th sexes, I added a bar chart plotting the proportions of murders stratified by the perpetrators' and victims' sexes.
