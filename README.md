-   Semyon Toybis - I created a vignette that uses the mutate function and stringr package from the TIDYVERSE to extract data from airline flight reviews, allowing for further analysis: <https://github.com/pkowalchuk/SPRING2024TIDYVERSE/blob/main/tidyverse_create_semyon_toybis.Rmd>

-   Ursula Podosenin - I created a vignette that focuses on the filter, group and mutate functions: <https://github.com/pkowalchuk/SPRING2024TIDYVERSE/blob/main/TidyVerse_Part_One.Rmd>

-   Kaylie Evans - Using the ggplot2 package, the following vignette was created: <https://github.com/pkowalchuk/SPRING2024TIDYVERSE/blob/main/KaylieEvansCREATE.Rmd>

    -   Rashad Long - Extended Kaylie's vignette, adding coorelation plots such as Jitter, Count, Scatter, and Bubble.

-   Keith DeNivo - *inadvertently* also created a vignette for forcats. <https://github.com/pkowalchuk/SPRING2024TIDYVERSE/blob/main/Keith_DeNivo_tidyverse_assignment.Rmd> using this dataset <https://github.com/pkowalchuk/SPRING2024TIDYVERSE/blob/main/cardekho.csv> factors used were the number of car owners.

    -   Naomi Buell extended Keith's vignette for forcats by adding how to add and drop factor levels.

-   Rashad Long - I created a vignette for the purrr package discussing the map() function: <https://github.com/pkowalchuk/SPRING2024TIDYVERSE/blob/main/Vignette_PURR_Rashad_Long.qmd> <br />

    -   Semyon Toybis - I extended Rashad's analysis to analyze total career touchdowns over the course of a career for a group of quarterbacks

**Chhiring Lama** - \< <https://github.com/pkowalchuk/SPRING2024TIDYVERSE/blob/main/DATA607_TidyVerseCREATE%20_Buell.Rmd> \> - Chhiring Lama - I have pushed a .jpg and .csv file for ML presentation. <br /> - Chhiring Lama - Added two code blocks on Naomi Buell's Tideverse CREATE Assignment; commited and pushed to remote repository.

-   Fares Alahdab - I created a vignette that shows the use of mutate, group_by, summarise, ggplot2, and cor() in a heart failure dataset: <https://github.com/pkowalchuk/SPRING2024TIDYVERSE/blob/main/607_Tidyverse_GitHubColab_Fares_Alahdab.qmd>

-   Fares Alahdab (part-2): using the interesting dataset on NY shooting incidents and associated RMD file (<https://github.com/pkowalchuk/SPRING2024TIDYVERSE/blob/main/TidyverseCreateAssignment.Rmd>), I made the following edits: (1)- I added the variable "STATISTICAL_MURDER_FLAG" to the variables kept from the main dataset when filtering as that seems important. (2)- The second bar plot for the victim age groups was missing the vic_age_distribution so I added it to code chunk 7. (3)- Using dplyr and ggplot2, I added a heat map showing the frequency of incidents by both the perpetrators' and victims' age groups. (4)- Focusing on th sexes, I added a bar chart plotting the proportions of murders stratified by the perpetrators' and victims' sexes.

-   Ursula Podosenin- I extended Puja Roy's Tidyverse CREATE assignment by adding two additional columns, one for the overall average price, and one that labels a drink as "cheaper" or "more expensive" when compared against the average price. I also plotted the frequency of the overall average of coffee prices and found the min and max values in the aata set.


- Amanda Fox: I extended Anna Moy's vignette about dplyr and ggplot with an example using several additional functions from each of these packages

- Anna Moy - I extended Natalie Kalukeerthie's vignette with additional examples of additional items that can be added to the ggplot.
